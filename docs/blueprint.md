- Background color: A very light cyan (#E0FFFF) for a clean, modern backdrop. The light background keeps the focus on the colorful designs.
- Accent color: A bright violet (#BF00FF), for interactive elements, drawing attention and visually harmonizing with the other hues.
- Font Pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body. 'Space Grotesk' conveys technology, while 'Inter' is clear and neutral for longer text.
- Use consistent, outlined icons to represent different product types, print options, and design tools.
- A grid-based layout that is responsive across different devices.
- Subtle transitions and loading animations to improve user experience without distracting from the creative process.
